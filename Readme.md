# InventoryTracker

## About

InventoryTracker is an open source **warehouse management application** (or at least an attempt of making one). It is
built in Java using Gradle and Spring Boot framework.

It is also my **first attempt at making a REST API and a web server in Java**. The project is **deprecated** and was
used to learn more about REST APIs, also it does not work.

It uses _Docker_ to deploy the application using _docker-compose_.

## Lessons learned:

1. Defining achievable goals
2. Write tests for API operations
3. Use proper data structures and suitable design patterns
4. Write docs and comments for yourself, not just others
5. Have expansion and configurability in mind
